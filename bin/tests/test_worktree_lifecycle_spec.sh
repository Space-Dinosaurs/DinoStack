#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Purpose: shell-level determinism smoke spec for the DS-118 worktree model
#          (bin/tests/worktree_model.py). Demonstrates that a violation the
#          model can detect is found DETERMINISTICALLY across repeated runs
#          (not flaky), by building a disposable scratch git repository
#          under a temp directory and never touching the real DinoStack
#          checkout, worktree, or branch state.
#
# Public API: none (standalone script; `bash bin/tests/test_worktree_lifecycle_spec.sh`).
#
# Upstream deps: bin/tests/worktree_model.py (imported via PYTHONPATH).
#
# Downstream consumers: CI; qa_criteria scenario 8 (this ticket's QA gate) -
#                       "demonstrates two distinct exit codes across three
#                       runs (0, 1, 1)".
#
# Failure modes: exits non-zero if the observed exit-code sequence across
#                the three runs is anything other than (0, 1, 1). Cleans up
#                its scratch repo on exit via a trap regardless of outcome.
#
# Performance: sub-second; two `git worktree add`/`remove` calls in a
#              throwaway repo.
